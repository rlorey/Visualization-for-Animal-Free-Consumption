# Visualize Animal-free Product Consumption by Eating Habits
## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a visual that is more preferable to a stacked bar chart for looking at possible relationships between the frequency of animal-free food consumption and the type of diet with which individuals identify .   

## Survey Details
The diet types that respondents selected included vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, flexitarians and meat-eaters. 

Animal-free products were described as meat-free or dairy-free, for example. 

Survey size included 45 vegans and other diet types included 100 or more respondents.  The data was collected in 2018 and January 2019 in Great Britain.

## Visual

Visual #1 - Stacked Bar Chart - Less Preferable

Visual #2 - Panel Bar Chart - More Preferable

In this visual, it is easier to compare the data for frequency of consumption to self-identified diet.  For example, in the first column, it is clear to see that as the respondents self-identify more with eating meat (from vegan to meat-eater) the daily consumption of Animal-Free products decreases.
