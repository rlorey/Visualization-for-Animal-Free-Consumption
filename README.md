### Visualize Animal-free Product Consumption by Eating Habits
###Purpose
###Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create a visual that is more preferable to a stacked bar chart for looking at possible relationships between the frequency of animal-free food consumption and the type of diet with which individuals identify .   

#Survey Details
The diet types that respondents selected included vegans, vegetarians, pescatarians, flexitarians and meat-eaters. 

Animal-free products were described as meat-free or dairy-free, for example. 

Survey size included 45 vegans and other diet types included 100 or more respondents.  The data was collected in 2018 and January 2019 in Great Britain.

In this visual, it is easier to compare the data for frequency of consumption to self-identified diet.  For example, in the first column, it is clear to see that as the respondents self-identify more with eating meat (from vegan to meat-eater) the daily consumption of Animal-Free products decreases.
